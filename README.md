2. Designed a fully responsive and user-friendly UI/UX tailored for both business and individual users.
3. Implemented a custom admin panel for product management, order tracking, and client communication.
4. Integrated a secure, step-by-step quote request system to support bank transfer workflows.
5. Built custom logic for pricing based on quantity and customer type (B2B/B2C).
